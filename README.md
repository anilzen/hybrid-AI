# Website of the Research Group on Hybrid-AI

Our multidisciplinary university research team, composed of experts in biophysics, physics, chemistry, neuromorphic engineering, and neuroscience, is set to revolutionize computing by developing Hybrid Adaptive Networks (HANs) that integrate the strengths of Living Neural Networks (LNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These HANs are designed to combine the best of both worlds: the adaptive, context-sensitive, and energy-efficient learning capabilities inherent in LNNs, with the speed, precision, and reproducibility of ANNs. The unique approach aims to create novel computing architectures that go beyond the limitations of traditional AI&ML systems, enabling advanced computing through synergy of biological & artificial systems.
